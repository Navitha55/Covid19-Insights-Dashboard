# Covid19-Insights-Dashboard
This repository contains an interactive Power BI dashboard built using the Covid-19 World dataset. The project demonstrates how business insights can be derived from sales data through data cleaning, visualization, and analysis. This dashboard provides insights into World Covid-19 datasets. 

## Features
- KPI Cards showing:
  * Total Deaths
  * Total Population
  * Total Cases
- Pie Chart â€“ Distribution of deaths across countries/locations
- Trend Analysis â€“ COVID-19 spread over time

## Objective
- To analyze the impact of COVID-19 worldwide, understand trends in cases and deaths, and compare across countries and populations using data visualization techniques.

## Tech Stack
- Power BI (dashboard creation & visualization)
- Python â€“ Preprocessing and handling missing values
- COVID-19 Dataset (collected from Kaggle)

## Steps Followed

### ðŸ”— Dataset
- This dataset is downloaded from kaggle.
- You can easily download it from Python script itself given with link to download the dataset.
